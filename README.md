# iOS_BadUSB

Welcome to the iOS_BadUSB GitHub repository, a collection of payload scripts designed to explore the capabilities of external keyboard commands on iOS devices. These scripts showcase the potential for automation and remote execution of tasks on iOS, but it's essential to understand that tampering with or accessing devices without explicit permission is illegal. This repository was solely created for educational and research purposes, and I strictly advise against using these scripts on devices without proper authorization.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Misusing these payload scripts to perform unauthorized actions on iOS devices may violate privacy laws and can lead to serious legal consequences. This repository is intended for responsible exploration and testing purposes only. Usage on devices without explicit consent is strictly prohibited.  I only test these scripts on my own devices and am not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by using them on other devices.

## Payload Scripts Overview

The iOS_BadUSB repository includes a collection of payload scripts that utilize the Rubber Ducky method to interact with iOS devices via an external keyboard. These scripts are designed to showcase the potential for automating tasks and executing remote commands on iOS devices, allowing for efficient and hands-free interactions.

Some of the key features of these payload scripts are:

- **Remote Automation:** The scripts allow users to execute various tasks on iOS devices remotely using external keyboard commands.

- **Efficiency and Convenience:** By automating actions on iOS, users can save time and effort, especially in repetitive tasks.

- **Customizability:** Users can modify and extend the scripts to suit their specific needs and explore different possibilities of automation.

It is important to reiterate that these payload scripts should only be used on devices with explicit permission and consent from the device owner. Any unauthorized usage may result in severe legal consequences. We strongly encourage responsible and ethical usage of this repository, respecting the privacy and rights of others.

Explore the potential of external keyboard commands on iOS devices responsibly and enjoy the benefits of automation without compromising integrity or legality. Happy exploring! üöÄüì±
